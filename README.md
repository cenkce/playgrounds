Playgrounds
===========

A bunch of simple vagrant/ansible based playgrounds, with different environments and services installed.

Mostly those vagrant based vms are used by myself to test or demonstrate things regarding different technologies and/or daemons.

I am publishing those VMs, as they might be able to help people in need of simple playgrounds containing a certain service. Pull requests with new playgrounds are of course always welcome.
